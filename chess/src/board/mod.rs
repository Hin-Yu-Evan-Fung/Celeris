//! # Module: `board`
//!
//! This module defines the core data structures and functionalities for representing a chess board
//! and managing its state. It includes the `Board` struct, which encapsulates the entire state of
//! a chess game, and the `BoardState` struct, which stores the state of the board at a specific
//! point in time.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The `board` module is a fundamental part of the chess engine, providing the basic building
//! blocks for representing the game state, managing piece positions, handling move history, and
//! enforcing game rules. It uses bitboards for efficient storage and manipulation of piece
//! locations and provides methods for accessing and modifying the board state.
//!
//! ## Key Components
//!
//! - **`Board`**: A struct representing the complete state of a chess game.
//!   - Contains bitboards for piece positions, occupied squares, and side to move.
//!   - Manages move counters, castling rights, en passant square, and game history.
//!   - Provides methods for accessing piece positions, occupied squares, and other board state information.
//!   - Implements `Display` for printing the board to the console.
//! - **`BoardState`**: A struct representing the state of the board at a specific point in time.
//!   - Stores information about castling rights, en passant square, captured piece, and move counters.
//!   - Includes Zobrist keys for position hashing and repetition detection.
//!   - Contains bitboard masks for move generation and legality checks.
//!
//! ## Functionality
//!
//! - **Board Creation**: `Board::new()` creates an empty board, while `Board::default()` creates a board with the standard starting position.
//! - **State Management**: `Board::store_state()` and `Board::restore_state()` manage the move history, allowing for undoing moves.
//! - **Piece Access**: `Board::on()` retrieves the piece on a given square.
//! - **Bitboard Access**: `Board::piecetype_bb()`, `Board::occupied_bb()`, `Board::all_occupied_bb()

/// # Board State (Used for move generation and history)
///
/// Stores the state of the board at a given point in time.
/// This is used to restore the board to a previous state after a move has been made (unmake move)
/// and to check for game rules like repetitions. It also caches information useful for move generation.
///
/// Caches the variables that cannot be rolled back in a predictable pattern, for example, the previously captured piece has to be stored or else it will be lost to history
///
/// ## Fields
/// - `enpassant`: The en passant square, if any, available on this turn. `None` if no en passant capture is possible.
/// - `castle`: The castling rights (`Castling`) available *before* the move that led to this state.
/// - `key`: The Zobrist key representing the board position (excluding pawn structure and move counters). Used for repetition detection.
/// - `pawn_key`: The Zobrist key specifically for the pawn structure. Potentially useful for pawn structure evaluation.
/// - `captured`: The `Piece` captured on the move leading to this state. `Piece::None` if no capture occurred. Essential for `unmake_move`.
/// - `repetitions`: The number of times this exact position (`key`) has been repeated in the game history up to this point.
/// - `fifty_move`: Counter for the fifty-move rule (number of plies since the last pawn move or capture).
/// - `check_mask`: A bitboard indicating squares that block or capture checking pieces. If not in check, this is typically all squares (`!0`).
/// - `diag_pin`: A bitboard representing squares occupied by pieces pinned diagonally to their king.
/// - `hv_pin`: A bitboard representing squares occupied by pieces pinned horizontally or vertically to their king.
/// - `king_ban`: A bitboard representing squares the king cannot move to (attacked squares or squares occupied by friendly pieces).
/// - `king_attacks`: A bitboard representing the squares attacked by the friendly king.
/// - `available`: A bitboard representing all squares not occupied by the side to move (potential destinations, excluding captures).
/// - `enpassant_pin`: A boolean indicating if the pawn performing an en passant capture is pinned to the king, making the en passant illegal.

/// # Chess Board Representation
///
/// Represents the complete state of a chess game at a specific point in time.
/// It encapsulates piece positions, castling rights, the side to move, move counters,
/// and a history of previous states for undoing moves and rule checking (like repetitions).
///
/// This struct is central to the chess engine's logic, providing the foundation for
/// move generation, move execution, and game state evaluation.
///
/// ## Representation
/// The board primarily uses `Bitboard`s for efficient storage and manipulation of piece locations.
///
/// ## Fields
/// - `pieces`: An array of `Bitboard`s, indexed by `PieceType`. Each bitboard (`pieces[PieceType::Pawn.index()]`)
///   stores the locations of all pieces of that specific type, regardless of colour.
/// - `occupied`: An array of `Bitboard`s, indexed by `Colour`. Each bitboard (`occupied[Colour::White.index()]`)
///   stores the locations of all pieces belonging to that specific colour. `occupied[0] | occupied[1]` gives all occupied squares.
/// - `side_to_move`: The `Colour` (White or Black) whose turn it is to move.
/// - `half_moves`: Counts the number of half-moves (plies) since the last capture or pawn advance.
///   Used for the fifty-move rule. It's incremented after each move and reset to 0 upon a capture or pawn move.
/// - `state`: The current `BoardState` of the board. This includes en passant square, castling rights,
///   captured piece, Zobrist keys, and move counters.
/// - `history`: A `Vec<BoardState>` acting as a stack. Each time a move is made, the current `BoardState`
///   (containing castling rights, en passant square, captured piece, keys, etc., *before* the move)
///   is pushed onto this stack. This allows for efficient `unmake_move` operations and tracking game history
///   for rules like three-fold repetition.
