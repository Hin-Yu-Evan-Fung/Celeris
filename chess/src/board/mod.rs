//! Represents the chess board, its state, and associated logic.
//!
//! This module is central to the chess engine, defining how a chess position
//! is stored and manipulated. It includes:
//! - The `Board` struct: the main representation of a chess game's state.
//! - The `BoardState` struct: stores per-move state information for undoing moves and checking rules.
//! - FEN parsing and generation.
//! - Move generation and application (delegated to submodules).
//! - Zobrist hashing for position identification.
