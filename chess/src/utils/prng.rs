//! # Module: `prng`
//!
//! This module provides a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) based on the Xorshiro128+
//! algorithm. It is designed for use in non-cryptographic applications, such as chess engines,
//! where speed and statistical quality are important.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The PRNG in this module is a fast, high-quality generator that produces a sequence of
//! pseudo-random numbers. It is based on the Xorshiro128+ algorithm, which is known for its
//! speed and good statistical properties. The PRNG can be seeded with a 64-bit value, allowing
//! for reproducible sequences of random numbers.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - **Fast Execution**: The Xorshiro128+ algorithm is computationally efficient, making it
//!   suitable for performance-critical applications.
//! - **High-Quality Randomness**: The generated numbers have good statistical properties,
//!   making them suitable for a wide range of applications.
//! - **Deterministic Output**: When seeded with the same value, the PRNG will produce the
//!   same sequence of random numbers. This is useful for testing and debugging.
//! - **Sparse Random Numbers**: The module provides a method for generating sparse random
//!   numbers, which have fewer bits set on average. This is useful for applications that
//!   require random bit patterns with low density.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The `PRNG` struct is the main component of this module. It can be created with a specific
//! seed or with a default seed. The `random_u64` method generates a random 64-bit unsigned
//! integer, and the `random_sparse_u64` method generates a sparse random 64-bit unsigned
//! integer.
//!
//! ## Implementation Details
//!
//! The PRNG is based on the Xorshiro256++ algorithm from [the PRNG page by Sebastiano Vigna](https://prng.di.unimi.it/xoshiro256plusplus.c).
//! The internal state of the PRNG is stored in four 64-bit unsigned integers. The `random_u64`
//! method updates the internal state and returns a new random number. The `random_sparse_u
